# Welcome to the Repository! ðŸ‘‹

Hey kiddo! I added a few things to this repository to make your life easier as you work on this project. Here's a quick rundown of what I set up:

## Changes I Made

1. **Code Review on `createTask5.js`**
   - I reviewed the `createTask5.js` file and left some comments for you to check out. Take a look and make sure to address them as you work through the code.

2. **Initialized `npm`**
   - `npm` stands for Node Package Manager. It's a tool for managing JavaScript packages (libraries).
   - While you won't use `npm` much in this project, I set it up to include tools like `eslint` and `prettier` (more on these below).

3. **Added a `.gitignore` File**
   - This file tells Git to ignore certain files and directories, such as the `node_modules` directory. The `node_modules` folder is huge and doesn't need to be tracked by Git.

4. **Set Up `eslint` and `prettier`**
   - `eslint`: A tool to help you write clean and consistent JavaScript code. It catches common programming errors and enforces a coding style (e.g., reminding you to add semicolons or flagging undefined variables).
   - `prettier`: A code formatter that keeps your code clean and readable by automatically applying consistent formatting rules.
   - These tools are configured to work together seamlessly, so they won't conflict.
   - You can use the following commands in the terminal:
     - `npm run lint`: Check your code for errors with `eslint`.
     - `npm run format`: Format your code with `prettier`.
   - You can also set up your editor to automatically format your code on save. If it's not already set up, go to settings (<kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>) and search for `editor.formatOnSave`.

5. **Created a `package.json` File**
   - This file contains metadata about the project and its dependencies. It was automatically generated when I set up `npm`. You donâ€™t need to worry about it for now, but itâ€™s crucial for the tools to work.

6. **VSCode Extensions List**
   - To make your life easier, I included a list of useful VSCode extensions at the bottom of the `createTask5.js` file. Check them out and install themâ€”they'll help a lot!

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run the following command in the terminal inside this directory to install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This will create a `node_modules` directory with all the required dependencies.

2. **Stay Updated**
   - Whenever you pull changes from this repository, remember to run `npm install` again to ensure you have the latest dependencies.

3. **Fixing Errors**
   - After setting everything up, youâ€™ll likely see a lot of errors being highlighted. o0oOOoÂ°oOo00Â°o scary ðŸ‘»
   - Work through them one step at a time, starting with the first error, as fixing it might resolve others.
   - If you get stuck, donâ€™t hesitate to ask for help.

## Final Thoughts

Take your time, and donâ€™t worry if things feel overwhelming at first. Programming is a skill you build step by step, and setting up a project like this is a great way to learn. You've got this! ðŸš€

Good luck with the project, and let me know if you need help!
