Hey kiddo, I added a few things to this repository to help you out.

1. I did a code review on `createTask5.js`. Check out the comments I left you.
2. I initialized `npm` in this repository. `npm` stands for Node Package Manager. It's a tool that helps you install and manage JavaScript packages (libraries). You won't be using it much in this project, but I added it for using `eslint` and `prettier`. (I'll explain what those are in a bit.)
3. I added a `.gitignore` file. This file tells Git to ignore certain files and directories. For example, we don't want to commit the `node_modules` directory to the repository because it's huge and contains a lot of files that we don't need to keep track of. (I'll explain what `node_modules` is in a bit.)
4. I set up `eslint` and `prettier` in this repository. `eslint` is a tool that helps you write clean and consistent JavaScript code. It can catch common programming errors and enforce a coding style. For example, it can warn you if you forget to put a semicolon at the end of a statement or if you use a variable that is not defined. `prettier` is a code formatter that automatically formats your code according to a set of rules. It can help you keep your code clean and readable. I configured `eslint` and `prettier` to work together so that they don't conflict with each other. You can use the terminal to run `npm run lint` to check your code with `eslint` and `npm run format` to format your code with `prettier`.
5. I added a `package.json` file. This file contains metadata about the project and the dependencies that it needs. You don't need to worry about this file too much, but it's important for `npm` to work properly. (It was automatically generated when I set up `npm` in this repository.)
6. I wrote a list of extentions that you can install in VSCode to make your life easier. You can find it in the bottom of [createTask5.js](createTask5.js).

I can walk you through these changes if you want. Just let me know. Good luck with the project! ðŸš€


P.S., you'll need to run `npm install` from the terminal in this directory to install the dependencies that I added. This will create a `node_modules` directory with the necessary packages. Remember to run `npm install` whenever you pull changes from the repository to make sure you have the latest dependencies.

Once you set everything up, you'll see a lot of errors being highlighted.
Relax, and take it one step at a time from the top. Always fix the first error before moving on to the next one, as subsequent errors might be caused by the first one. If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help.
