### **1. `move(dir)`**

- Determines the direction of movement based on the userâ€™s input (`dir`).
- Calls the appropriate logic (e.g., `zeroSwap`, `merge`, `updateHTMLGrid`) to handle moving tiles in the specified direction.
- Handles invalid inputs by displaying an error message.
- **Incomplete for "up" and "left" directions.**

---

### **2. `zeroSwap(i, j)`**

- Moves non-zero values to the right by swapping with zeros in the row.
- Ensures tiles are aligned correctly before merging.
- Loops until no zeros are found to the right of the current value.

---

### **3. `leftZeroSwap(i, j)`** _(Placeholder)_

- **Not yet implemented.**
- Presumably will handle moving non-zero values to the left by swapping with zeros.

---

### **4. `transpose(grid)`**

- Converts the grid so rows become columns and columns become rows.
- Useful for handling movement logic in vertical directions (e.g., "up" or "down") using horizontal logic.

---

### **5. `merge(i, j)`**

- Merges tiles in the row when two adjacent tiles have the same value and are non-zero.
- Clears the original tile (`grid[i][j] = 0`) after merging.
- Calls `zeroSwap` to ensure the tiles remain in the correct order after merging.

---

### **6. `mergeLeft(i, j)`** _(Placeholder)_

- **Not yet implemented.**
- Presumably will handle merging logic for the "left" direction.

---

### **7. `updateHTMLGrid()`**

- Updates the HTML representation of the grid.
- Populates the rows of the grid in the HTML document using `document.getElementById`.
